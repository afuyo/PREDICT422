DESCRIPTION:Get started with machine learning using TensorFlow\, the popul
 ar open source machine-learning software developed by Google’s Brain tea
 m.\n\nIn this online course\, you’ll learn core concepts in machine lear
 ning and TensorFlow with a focus on neural networks. You&#39\;ll gain expe
 rience working with TensorFlow’s collection of visualization tools\, inc
 luding building and launching graphs in TensorFlow and using TensorBoard t
 o visualize workflow and evaluate model performance. The instructors use  
 notebooks with interactive code segments to guide you as you apply machine
 -learning concepts and build algorithms that make predictions using real-w
 orld datasets. By the end of the course\, you’ll know how and when to us
 e TensorFlow in your own applications.\n\n\nGo to the event (https://www.s
