DESCRIPTION:**Building a distributed pipeline** is a huge—and complex—
 undertaking. If you want to ensure yours is scalable\, has fast in-memory 
 processing\, can handle real-time or streaming data feeds with high throug
 hput and low-latency\, is well suited for ad-hoc queries\, can be spread a
 cross multiple data centers\, is built to allocate resources efficiently\,
  and is designed to allow for future changes\, join Andy Petrella and Xavi
